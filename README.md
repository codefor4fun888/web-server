Simple C Web Server

This little project is a great way for me to learn more about C and how servers work.
The code sets up a basic web server using low level socket functions, so I can actually see how data moves across the internet. By creating a socket, binding it to a port, and accepting connections, I’m learning the real foundations behind networking the stuff bigger frameworks hide from me.

It’s a clean, hands-on example that helps me understand both C programming and server fundamentals at the same time. It’s perfect for leveling up my skills in networking, system programming, and understanding how the web works behind the scenes.
