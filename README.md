This little project is a great way to learn more about C and how servers work.
The code sets up a basic web server using low-level socket functions, so you can actually see how data moves across the internet. By creating a socket, binding it to a port, and accepting connections, you’re learning the real foundations behind networking — the stuff bigger frameworks hide from you.

It’s a clean, hands-on example that helps you understand both C programming and server fundamentals at the same time. Perfect for leveling up your skills in networking, system programming, and how the web really works under the hood.
