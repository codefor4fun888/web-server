# MOST UPDATED built web server from scratch project-
README 

This project was a great way for me to learn more about C and how servers work.
The code sets up a basic web server using low level socket functions, so I can actually see how data moves across the internet. By creating a socket, binding it to a port, and accepting connections


deeper understanding: 

It’s built on raw sockets no frameworks, no shortcuts. This project is a lightweight HTTP server written entirely in C using raw TCP sockets. It sets up a listening socket, waits for incoming client connections, prints the incoming HTTP request, and sends back a basic HTML response.
